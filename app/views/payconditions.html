  <h2 class="heading-medium">4. Pay and conditions for apprentices</h2>

<p>You must pay apprentices at least the <a href="#">minimum wage rate</a>.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information on apprenticeship levy" class="panel panel-border-wide">
<p>The <a href="#">National Minimum Wage calculator</a> works out the exact amount that you have to pay an employee.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Conditions</h2>

<p>Apprentices usually work for at least 30 paid hours a week and must work more than 16.</p>

<p>You must pay your apprentice for time spent training or studying for a relevant qualification, whether while at work or at a college or training organisation.</p>

<p>You must offer apprentices the same conditions as other employees working at similar grades or in similar roles. This includes:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
  <li>paid holidays</li>
  <li>sick pay</li>
  <li>any benefits you offer such as childcare voucher schemes</li>
  <li>any support you offer such as coaching or mentoring</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Apprentices and redundancy</h2>

<p>You can’t usually make an apprentice redundant simply because you can’t afford to pay them, (for example, if your company runs out of work).</p>

<p>You should get legal advice if you think you might have to make an apprentice redundant or want to end the apprenticeship early for another reason.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re unsure whether you can commit to a full apprenticeship but would still like to hire an apprentice, you can use an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/take-on-an-apprentice/apprenticeship-training-agencies">apprenticeship training agency</a>.</p>
