  <h2 class="heading-medium">1. Overview</h1>

  <p>Apprentices must be aged 16 or over and combine working with learning - from GCSEs or equivalent up to degree level.</p>

<p>Apprentices can be new or current employees.</p>

<p>If you hire an apprentice you must:</p>
<ul class="list list-bullet">
  <li>usually employ them for at least 30 hours per week</li>
  <li>pay them at least the minimum wage for apprentices</li>
  <li>offer them the same conditions and benefits offered to other employees working at a similar level</li>
  <li>provide experience and opportunities to help with future progression</li>
  <li>allow them  to attend training and assessment during their working hours</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Funding your apprenctices</h2>

<p>Funding is available if you employ an apprentice in England.</p>

<p>If your organisation has a payroll of over £3 million, from April 2017 you will pay the <a href="https://das-informmicrosite.herokuapp.com/public/external/link_appLevy.html">apprenticeship levy</a> to fund apprentices.</p>

<p>If you don’t pay the levy, you could get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/take-on-an-apprentice/employer-grants-apprentices">grant or funding</a> to employ an apprentice.</p>


<h2 class="heading-medium">Hire an apprentice</h2>

<p>How you employ an apprentice depends on whether your organisation pays the apprenticeship levy or not.</p>

<p>Levy payers must use the <a href="https://das-informmicrosite.herokuapp.com/#">Digital Apprenticeship Service</a>.</p>
